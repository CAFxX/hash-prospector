# Hash Function Prospector

This is a little tool for automated [integer hash function][wang]
discovery. It generates billions of [integer hash functions][jenkins] at
random from a selection of [nine reversible operations][rev]. The
generated functions are JIT compiled and their avalanche behavior is
evaluated. The current best function is printed out in C syntax.

The *avalanche score* is the number of output bits that remain "fixed"
on average when a single input bit is flipped. Lower scores are better.
Ideally the score is 0 â€” e.g. every output bit flips with a 50% chance
when a single input bit is flipped.

Prospector can generate both 32-bit and 64-bit integer hash functions.
Check the usage (`-h`) for the full selection of options. Due to the JIT
compiler, only x86-64 is supported, though the functions it discovers
can, of course, be used anywhere.

## Discovered Functions

So far I've used prospector to discover these two high quality 32-bit
integer hash functions:

```c
/* Avalanche score = 1.67
 * Compiles to only 23 bytes on x86-64
 * High avalanche
 * 6 billion hashes / second (Haswell)
 */
uint32_t
mosquito32(uint32_t x)
{
    x  = ~x;
    x ^= x >> 16;
    x *= UINT32_C(0xdce6558f);
    x ^= x >> 9;
    return x;
}

/* Avalanche score = 1.1875
 * Very effective avalanche
 * 4 billion hashes / second (Haswell)
 */
uint32_t
skeeto32(uint32_t x)
{
    x = ~x;
    x ^= x << 16;
    x ^= x >> 1;
    x ^= x << 13;
    x ^= x >> 4;
    x ^= x >> 12;
    x ^= x >> 2;
    return x;
}
```

The first can be converted into an excellent string hash function:

```c
/* Around 2%-4% slower than MurmurHash3 (Haswell)
 * Equivalent collision properties as MurmurHash3 for UTF-8 strings
 */
static uint32_t
mosquito32s(const void *buf, size_t len, uint32_t key)
{
    uint32_t hash = key;
    const unsigned char *p = buf;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        hash += p[i];
        hash ^= hash >> 16;
        hash *= UINT32_C(0xdce6558f);
        hash ^= hash >> 9;
    }
    return hash;
}
```

## Reversible operation selection

```c
x  = ~x;
x ^= constant;
x *= constant; // only odd constants
x += constant;
x ^= x >> constant;
x ^= x << constant;
x += x << constant;
x -= x << constant;
x = (x << constant) | (x >> (nbits - constant));
```

Technically `x = ~x` is covered by `x = ^= constant`. However, `~x` is
uniquely special and particularly useful. The generator is very unlikely
to generate the one correct constant for the XOR operator that achieves
the same effect.
