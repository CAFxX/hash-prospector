# Hash Function Prospector

This is a little tool for automated [integer hash function][wang]
discovery. It generates billions of [integer hash functions][jenkins] at
random from a selection of [nine reversible operations][rev]. The
generated functions are JIT compiled and their avalanche behavior is
evaluated. The current best function is printed out in C syntax.

The *avalanche score* is the number of output bits that remain "fixed"
on average when a single input bit is flipped. Lower scores are better.
Ideally the score is 0 â€” e.g. every output bit flips with a 50% chance
when a single input bit is flipped.

Prospector can generate both 32-bit and 64-bit integer hash functions.
Check the usage (`-h`) for the full selection of options. Due to the JIT
compiler, only x86-64 is supported, though the functions it discovers
can, of course, be used anywhere.

## Discovered Hash Functions

There are two useful classes of hash functions discovered by the
prospector and the other helper utilities here. Both use an
*xorshift-multiply-xorshift* construction, but with a different number
of rounds.

### Two round functions

This 32-bit integer hash function has the lowest bias of any in this
form ever devised. It even beats the venerable MurmurHash3 32-bit
finalizer by a tiny margin. The hash function construction was
discovered by the prospector, then the parameters were tuned using hill
climbing and a genetic algorithm.

```c
// exact bias: 0.19768193144773874
uint32_t
lowbias32(uint32_t x)
{
    x ^= x >> 18;
    x *= UINT32_C(0xa136aaad);
    x ^= x >> 16;
    x *= UINT32_C(0x9f6d62d7);
    x ^= x >> 17;
    return x;
}

// inverse
uint32_t
lowbias32_r(uint32_t x)
{
    x ^= x >> 17;
    x *= UINT32_C(0x5f68b0e7);
    x ^= x >> 16;
    x *= UINT32_C(0x79e64925);
    x ^= x >> 18;
    return x;
}
```

Here are some alternate constants nearly as unbiased:

    [16 e2d0d4cb 15 3c6ad939 15] = 0.20207553121367283
    [17 5abe3ae5 13 65639657 16] = 0.20650238245274932
    [16 b7b9e4ad 14 e5328a63 18] = 0.21832717182470052
    [16 0c166973 14 99ad7299 16] = 0.22090427396118206
    [15 a3d94b57 15 f2c5b5d1 15] = 0.22113662508346502
    [15 4985c6a9 15 07624b2f 16] = 0.22259897535212997
    [16 5f695533 16 12e558d3 16] = 0.23112382120352101
    [16 a72f8c9d 14 aa189b8b 16] = 0.23114381371006168
    [16 d76531b5 13 eb08cda5 16] = 0.24091505615019371
    [16 952f8b96 13 f0b5b4d9 16] = 0.24095657705827211
    [17 c8a26cb3 14 11e51a2e 16] = 0.24114117830601392
    [16 893de54a 13 3a26ba99 17] = 0.24140065800283472
    [17 7df48b9b 14 bcd79a97 18] = 0.24276241306126728
    [16 eea6964b 15 e709335b 16] = 0.24539011228453952
    [16 86d2a755 15 9ab7395b 16] = 0.24699551475218956
    [16 2c88c9a7 13 a1f2b677 16] = 0.24858972550242134

This next function was discovered using only the prospector. It has a bit more
bias than the previous function.

```c
// exact bias: 0.34968228323361017
uint32_t
prospector32(uint32_t x)
{
    x ^= x >> 15;
    x *= UINT32_C(0x2c1b3c6d);
    x ^= x >> 12;
    x *= UINT32_C(0x297a2d39);
    x ^= x >> 15;
    return x;
}
```

To use the prospector search randomly for alternative multiplication constants,
run it like so:

    $ ./prospector -p xorr:15,mul,xorr:12,mul,xorr:15

### Three round functions

Another round of multiply-xorshift in this construction allows functions
with carefully chosen parameters to reach the theoretical bias limit
(bias = ~0.021). For example, this hash function is indistinguishable
from a perfect PRF (e.g. a random permutation of all 32-bit integers):

```c
// exact bias: 0.020888578919738908
uint32_t
triple32(uint32_t x)
{
    x ^= x >> 17;
    x *= UINT32_C(0xed5ad4bb);
    x ^= x >> 11;
    x *= UINT32_C(0xac4c1b51);
    x ^= x >> 15;
    x *= UINT32_C(0x31848bab);
    x ^= x >> 14;
    return x;
}

// inverse
uint32_t
triple32_r(uint32_t x)
{
    x ^= x >> 14 ^ x >> 28;
    x *= UINT32_C(0x32b21703);
    x ^= x >> 15 ^ x >> 30;
    x *= UINT32_C(0x469e0db1);
    x ^= x >> 11 ^ x >> 22;
    x *= UINT32_C(0x79a85073);
    x ^= x >> 17;
    return x;
}
```

And here are some alternate constants which are nearly as unbiased:

    [18 4260bb47 13 27e8e1ed 15 9d48a33b 15] = 0.021576730651802156
    [15 5dfa224b 14 4bee7e4b 17 930ee371 15] = 0.02184521628884813
    [16 2bbed51b 14 cd09896b 16 38d4c587 15] = 0.022159936298777144
    [16 0ab694cd 14 4c139e47 16 11a42c3b 16] = 0.02220928191220355
    [16 66e756d5 14 b5f5a9cd 16 84e56b11 16] = 0.022372957847491555
    [16 45109e55 14 3b94759d 16 adf31ea5 17] = 0.022436433678417977
    [16 7001e6eb 14 bb8e7313 16 3aa8c523 15] = 0.022491767264054854
    [16 49ed0a13 14 83588f29 15 658f258d 15] = 0.022500668856510898
    [16 6cdb9705 14 4d58d2ed 14 c8642b37 16] = 0.022504626537729222
    [15 fc54c453 13 08213789 15 669f96eb 16] = 0.022591114646032095
    [16 13566dbb 14 59369a03 15 990f9d1b 16] = 0.022712430070797596

Prepending an increment to `triple32` breaks the `hash(0) = 0` issue while
also lowering the bias a tiny bit further:

```c
// exact bias: 0.020829410544597495
uint32_t
triple32inc(uint32_t x)
{
    x++;
    x ^= x >> 17;
    x *= UINT32_C(0xed5ad4bb);
    x ^= x >> 11;
    x *= UINT32_C(0xac4c1b51);
    x ^= x >> 15;
    x *= UINT32_C(0x31848bab);
    x ^= x >> 14;
    return x;
}

// inverse
uint32_t
triple32inc_r(uint32_t x)
{
    x ^= x >> 14 ^ x >> 28;
    x *= UINT32_C(0x32b21703);
    x ^= x >> 15 ^ x >> 30;
    x *= UINT32_C(0x469e0db1);
    x ^= x >> 11 ^ x >> 22;
    x *= UINT32_C(0x79a85073);
    x ^= x >> 17;
    x--;
    return x;
}
```

## Measuring exact bias

The `-E` mode evaluates the bias of a given hash function (`-p` or `-l`). By
default the prospector uses an estimate to quickly evaluate a function's bias,
but it's non-deterministic and there's a lot of noise in the result. To
exhaustively measure the exact bias, use the `-e` option.

The function to be checked can be defined using `-p` and a pattern or
`-l` and a shared library containing a function named `hash()`. For
example, to measure the exact bias of the best hash function above:

    $ ./prospector -Eep xorr:16,mul:e2d0d4cb,xorr:15,mul:3c6ad939,xorr:15

Or drop the function in a C file named hash.c, and name the function
`hash()`. This lets you test hash functions that can't be represented
using the prospector's limited notion of hash functions.

    $ cc -O3 -shared -fPIC -l hash.so hash.c
    $ ./prospector -Eel ./hash.so

By default it treats its input as a 32-bit hash function. Use the `-8`
switch to test (by estimation) 64-bit functions. There is no exact,
exhaustive test for 64-bit hash functions since that would take far too
long.

## Reversible operation selection

```c
x  = ~x;
x ^= constant;
x *= constant | 1; // e.g. only odd constants
x += constant;
x ^= x >> constant;
x ^= x << constant;
x += x << constant;
x -= x << constant;
x <<<= constant; // left rotation
```

Technically `x = ~x` is covered by `x = ^= constant`. However, `~x` is
uniquely special and particularly useful. The generator is very unlikely
to generate the one correct constant for the XOR operator that achieves
the same effect.
