# Hash Function Prospector

This is a little tool for automated [integer hash function][wang]
discovery. It generates billions of [integer hash functions][jenkins] at
random from a selection of [nine reversible operations][rev]. The
generated functions are JIT compiled and their avalanche behavior is
evaluated. The current best function is printed out in C syntax.

The *avalanche score* is the number of output bits that remain "fixed"
on average when a single input bit is flipped. Lower scores are better.
Ideally the score is 0 â€” e.g. every output bit flips with a 50% chance
when a single input bit is flipped.

Prospector can generate both 32-bit and 64-bit integer hash functions.
Check the usage (`-h`) for the full selection of options. Due to the JIT
compiler, only x86-64 is supported, though the functions it discovers
can, of course, be used anywhere.

## Discovered Hash Functions

This hash function has an extremely low bias (1.03 @ -q20), lower than
any other 32-bit hash function I've found elsewhere.

```c
uint32_t
hash32(uint32_t x)
{
    x ^= x >> 15;
    x *= UINT32_C(0x2c1b3c6d);
    x ^= x >> 12;
    x *= UINT32_C(0x297a2d39);
    x ^= x >> 15;
    return x;
}
```

## Reversible operation selection

```c
x  = ~x;
x ^= constant;
x *= constant; // only odd constants
x += constant;
x ^= x >> constant;
x ^= x << constant;
x += x << constant;
x -= x << constant;
x = (x << constant) | (x >> (nbits - constant));
```

Technically `x = ~x` is covered by `x = ^= constant`. However, `~x` is
uniquely special and particularly useful. The generator is very unlikely
to generate the one correct constant for the XOR operator that achieves
the same effect.
